# Creating Build Node

The build node can be used to create SD cards for the infra gateway.  The gateway can be created with README-gateway.md and will be a firewall + caching proxy + netboot server.  The build node will have some development tools installed, and can be a desktop.

First install ubuntu onto the SD Card using the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software).  Choose "Other general-purpose OS" then "Ubuntu" then the latest "Ubuntu Server" or "Ubuntu Desktop" LTS, which will work on a number of Raspberry Pis.

Boot the Pi with the new card, using "ubuntu/ubuntu", please give it an extra minute after the login prompt for cloud-init to complete and create the user.  Use SSH might work if the IP can be determined from the DHCP server to avoid requiring a monitor+keyboard (if can determine the IP address, the hostname will be ubuntu).

After SSH-ing in and changing the default password, add a .pub SSH key for convenience, the type "ed25519" is OK (in 2022).

Copy the build-node scripts over to the build node using scp.  These scripts are generated by rundoc and are committed into the repo so the local machine does not require rundoc.

```
BUILD_NODE=build-node.local
scp build-node build-node-ip:
```

Update vars.sh on the build node before running setup.sh:

```
(cd build-node && bash setup.sh)
```

setup.sh will run a series of scripts:

```create-file:build-node/setup.sh
#!/bin/bash
# created by README-build-node.md
set -euo pipefail
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -N "" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
. upgrade.sh
. packages.sh
. python-packages.sh
. apply-config.sh
sudo systemctl reboot
```

## Prepare Build Node

The first script is upgrade.sh, it updates the package cache, upgrades the system. Note: security updates will no longer be automatically applied.

```create-file:build-node/upgrade.sh
#!/bin/bash
# created by README-build-node.md
set -e
sudo apt remove unattended-upgrades
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Then packages.sh will install ubuntu packages and snaps in packages.sh
```create-file:build-node/packages.sh
#!/bin/bash
# created by README-build-node.md
set -e
sudo apt install -y silversearcher-ag make gcc rng-tools
sudo snap install --classic nvim
sudo snap install --classic go
```

Then python packages will be installed in python-packages.sh

```create-file:build-node/python-packages.sh
#!/bin/bash
# created by README-build-node.md
set -e
pip3 install --user rundoc
```

These vars can be edited, they will be included by other scripts
```env
WIFI_SSID=
WIFI_PASSWORD=
UBUNTU_VERSION=22.04
UBUNTU_PATCH_VERSION=1
```

## Create Ubuntu and cloud-init configuration for SD Card

### Networking configuration for build-node Ubuntu
Set up interfaces.  `eth0` and `wlan0` are connected to external network.

Interface for network as DHCP
```create-file:build-node/eth0.yaml
# created by README-build-node.md
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    ethernets:
        eth1:
            optional: true
            dhcp4: true
            # do not release IP address
            critical: true
            link-local: [ipv4]
```

Wireless network, assumes that vars.sh was updated with WIFI SSID and password.

```r-create-file:build-node/wlan0.yaml
# created by README-build-node.md
network:
    version: 2
    renderer: networkd
    wifis:
        wlan0:
            # allow OS to start (while still building boot sequeuence)
            optional: true
            # do not release IP address
            critical: true
            dhcp4: true
            access-points:
                "%:WIFI_SSID:%":
                    password: "%:WIFI_PASSWORD:%"
```

Set the hostname

```create-file:build-node/hostname
# created by README-build-node.md
build-node
```


## Apply Configuration
```r-create-file:build-node/apply-config.sh
#!/bin/bash
# created by README-build-node.md
set -euo pipefail

if [[ "%:WIFI_SSID:%" != "" ]]; then
    sudo cp wlan0.yaml /etc/netplan/
fi
sudo cp eth0.yaml /etc/netplan/
sudo rm -f /etc/netplan/99-cloud-init.yaml
sudo cp hostname /etc/
```
